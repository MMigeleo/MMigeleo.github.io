            <center>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien ( 3 January 1892 - 2 September 1973) was an English writer and
                philologist. He
                was the author of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

                From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of
                Pembroke
                College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become the Merton
                Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these positions from
                1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the
                informal
                literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire
                by
                Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.

                After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive
                notes
                and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of
                the
                Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary
                essays
                about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied
                the
                term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.

                While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit
                and
                The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused him to be
                popularly
                identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literatureâ€”or, more precisely, of high fantasy.</center>
