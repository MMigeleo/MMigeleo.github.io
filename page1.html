        <center>The Silmarillion (Quenya: [silmaˈrilliɔn]) is a collection of myths[T 1] and stories in varying styles
            by the English writer J. R. R. Tolkien. It was edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher
            Tolkien in 1977, assisted by the fantasy author Guy Gavriel Kay.[T 2] It tells of Eä, a fictional universe
            that includes the Blessed Realm of Valinor, the once-great region of Beleriand, the sunken island of
            Númenor, and the continent of Middle-earth, where Tolkien's most popular works—The Hobbit and The Lord of
            the Rings—are set. After the success of The Hobbit, Tolkien's publisher Stanley Unwin requested a sequel,
            and Tolkien offered a draft of the writings that would later become The Silmarillion. Unwin rejected this
            proposal, calling the draft obscure and "too Celtic", so Tolkien began working on a new story that
            eventually became The Lord of the Rings.

            The Silmarillion has five parts. The first, Ainulindalë, tells in mythic style of the creation of Eä, the
            "world that is." The second part, Valaquenta, gives a description of the Valar and Maiar, supernatural
            powers of Eä. The next section, Quenta Silmarillion, which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the
            history of the events before and during the First Age, including the wars over three jewels, the Silmarils,
            that gave the book its title. The fourth part, Akallabêth, relates the history of the Downfall of Númenor
            and its people, which takes place in the Second Age. The final part, Of the Rings of Power and the Third
            Age, is a brief summary of the events of The Lord of the Rings and those that led to them.

            The book shows the influence of many sources, including the Finnish epic Kalevala, Greek mythology in the
            lost island of Atlantis (as Númenor) and the Olympian gods (in the shape of the Valar, though these also
            resemble the Norse Æsir).

            Because J. R. R. Tolkien died leaving his legendarium unedited, Christopher Tolkien selected and edited
            materials to tell the story from start to end. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely
            new material, within the tenor of his father's thought, to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the
            narrative,[3] particularly Chapter 22, "Of the Ruin of Doriath".</center>
