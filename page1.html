            <center>The Silmarillion (Quenya: [silmaˈrilliɔn]) is a collection of myths[T 1] and stories in varying
                styles
                by the English writer J. R. R. Tolkien. It was edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher
                Tolkien in 1977, assisted by the fantasy author Guy Gavriel Kay.[T 2] It tells of Eä, a fictional
                universe
                that includes the Blessed Realm of Valinor, the once-great region of Beleriand, the sunken island of
                Númenor, and the continent of Middle-earth, where Tolkien's most popular works—The Hobbit and The Lord
                of
                the Rings—are set. After the success of The Hobbit, Tolkien's publisher Stanley Unwin requested a
                sequel,
                and Tolkien offered a draft of the writings that would later become The Silmarillion. Unwin rejected
                this
                proposal, calling the draft obscure and "too Celtic", so Tolkien began working on a new story that
                eventually became The Lord of the Rings.

                The Silmarillion has five parts. The first, Ainulindalë, tells in mythic style of the creation of Eä,
                the
                "world that is." The second part, Valaquenta, gives a description of the Valar and Maiar, supernatural
                powers of Eä. The next section, Quenta Silmarillion, which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles
                the
                history of the events before and during the First Age, including the wars over three jewels, the
                Silmarils,
                that gave the book its title. The fourth part, Akallabêth, relates the history of the Downfall of
                Númenor
                and its people, which takes place in the Second Age. The final part, Of the Rings of Power and the Third
                Age, is a brief summary of the events of The Lord of the Rings and those that led to them.

                The book shows the influence of many sources, including the Finnish epic Kalevala, Greek mythology in
                the
                lost island of Atlantis (as Númenor) and the Olympian gods (in the shape of the Valar, though these also
                resemble the Norse Æsir).

                Because J. R. R. Tolkien died leaving his legendarium unedited, Christopher Tolkien selected and edited
                materials to tell the story from start to end. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise
                completely
                new material, within the tenor of his father's thought, to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the
                narrative,[3] particularly Chapter 22, "Of the Ruin of Doriath".</center>
